## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 07, Part 1
I really enjoyed how the Parking Rules lab pushed me to use real-world logic with C++. Creating functions to create parking signs for various streets was a great way to practice the modularity with programming and better my understanding of conditional statements. I also valued the lab's focus on input validationâ€”it made me think critically about managing incorrect or unexpected input, which is key to writing dependable code. The organized workflow with make, make unittest, and make lint provided me with useful experience in debugging and testing tools that are often used in the industry. Tackling compile-time errors, runtime bugs, and logic problems helped my confidence in my problem-solving abilities. What I really enjoyed about this lab was its practicality, figuring out if parking was allowed at a certain time felt like something a parking app would do. All in all, I think this lab was an awesome way to apply programming concepts to a real-world issue, and it truly helped me develop as a coder.
