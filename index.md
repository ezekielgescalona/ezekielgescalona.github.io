I am a current third year computer science major at California State University-Fullerton and I plan on graduating in 2026. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 07, Part 1
I really enjoyed how the Parking Rules lab pushed me to use real-world logic with C++. Creating functions to create parking signs for various streets was a great way to practice the modularity with programming and better my understanding of conditional statements. I also valued the lab's focus on input validation—it made me think critically about managing incorrect or unexpected input, which is key to writing dependable code. The organized workflow with make, make unittest, and make lint provided me with useful experience in debugging and testing tools that are often used in the industry. Tackling compile-time errors, runtime bugs, and logic problems helped my confidence in my problem-solving abilities. What I really enjoyed about this lab was its practicality, figuring out if parking was allowed at a certain time felt like something a parking app would do. All in all, I think this lab was an awesome way to apply programming concepts to a real-world issue, and it truly helped me develop as a coder.

Lab 03, Part 2
I found the 'Date Difference' lab to be enjoyable and educational, as it took into account a practical issue—determining the number of days between two dates—into an engaging learning opportunity. The application of the Julian Day formula through integer manipulation made better my understanding of how dates can be numerically represented, clarifying the mathematical principles with date differences. Developing functions such as 'Julian Day', 'Date Difference', and 'Print Day' provided me with significant practice in function definition and logical reasoning. Additionally, I enjoyed the lab's focus on precision, specifically when it came to leap years and formulas, which made want me to exercise caution in my coding and strengthen my debugging capabilities. In summary, this laboratory was an excellent means to link C++ programming with practical applications, while also reinforcing essential skills such as input management, arithmetic reasoning, and keeping a clean coding set of standards.
